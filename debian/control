Description: Make a directory and its parents if needed - Think mkdir -p
 Advantages over mkdirp
  - Promise API (Async/await ready!)
  - Fixes many mkdirp issues
  - 100% test coverage
  - CI-tested on macOS, Linux, and Windows
  - Actively maintained
  - Doesn't bundle a CLI
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
